# Dmenu Scripts (dmscripts)

![Screenshot of dmenu](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/raw/master/.screenshots/dmenu-distrotube01.png) 

This is a collection of dmenu scripts that I have found useful in my day-to-day activities as a desktop Linux user.  These are scripts that I personally use but this repository is open to the community.  If you would like to contribute your own scripts or improve any existing scripts, I would be happy to review your merge requests.  All scripts should be written in Bash and should use "/usr/share/env bash" as the shebang line rather than "/bin/sh" which is annoying for non-POSIX shell users like me (I use Fish).

The scripts included in this repo are:
+ dman - Search for a manpage of get a random one.
+ dmconf - Choose from a list of configuration files to edit.
+ dmlogout - Logout, shutdown, reboot or lock screen.
+ dmkill - Search for a process to kill.
+ dmqute - Search your qutebrowser bookmarks, quickmarks and history urls.
+ dmred - Dmenu as a reddit viewer using reddio. *STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
+ dmsearch - Search various search engines (inspired by surfraw).
